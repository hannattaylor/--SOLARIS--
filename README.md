# SOLSYSTEMET - SOLARIS

A project about our solarsystem made in December 2021 for a Javascript-course.

## My second JS-project

This is my second ever JS-project and the first time using an API to fetch the planet-data. 

- Click on a planet to go the that planets page for more info. 
- You can navigate between planets by clicking on the smaller planets on the left or right side of the page.
- Includes a searchpage were you can search for letters, planet-names or moons.
